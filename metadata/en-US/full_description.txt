ad-free is an ad audio blocker for Android.

This app is a research project attempting to show flaws in the way how
audio advertisement is shown on Android. It is a proof-of-concept of a
modularized audio ad blocker written in Kotlin with a modern and
simplistic user interface.

- Support for Spotify, Soundcloud, Deezer, Accuradio
- No root required
- Plugin based design
- Mute audio when ads are playing
- Play arbitrary audio

You can pick from one of three options to play instead of the ad:

1. Mute audio
2. Local music files
3. Interdimensional Cable from Rick and Morty (discontinued)
